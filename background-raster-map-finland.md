The below example Open Data Product Specification is created by ODPS developers and is not official version. You can find the original information of National Land Survey of FinlandÂ´s Background map (raster) from https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/en/maps-and-spatial-data/expert-users/product-descriptions/background-map-series-raster

This example is the compact version data product description you can you with ODPS. Also the open data license link is added with extension function instead of using ODPS built-in machine-readable formatting.

Example with Open Data Product Specification 2.1. https://open-data-product-initiative.github.io/open-data-product-spec-2.1
