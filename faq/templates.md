# ODPS Starter Templates 

The `odps-examples` repository (the official ODPS knowledge base) includes ready-made templates to help you start faster with ODPS:

## Full "Hello World" Example
- A complete, fully-featured ODPS product definition in YAML.
- Includes metadata, pricing plans (e.g. free + paid tiers), multilingual descriptions, SLAs, data quality, access control, and more.
- Ideal for understanding a full end-to-end ODPS product.

## Minimal “Mandatory-Only” Example
- Contains only the required sections of an ODPS product definition.
- Clean and lightweight—great as a starter scaffold or for experimentation.

## Modular Snippets
- Inline YAML snippets found in FAQ articles.
- Covers common components: metadata, pricing, SLAs, data quality rules, access roles, AI/agent support, and more.
- These can be copy-pasted and combined as needed to build custom ODPS products.
