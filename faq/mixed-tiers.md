# Can I Offer Free and Paid Tiers in the Same Product?

Yes, offering **both free and paid tiers** within the same data product is a widely used and recommended strategy. This approach is called **freemium tiered pricing**. It allows you to:

1. **Attract users with a free tier** â€“ Lower barrier to entry, especially useful in open data and SaaS models.
2. **Upsell premium features** â€“ Offer value-added features, higher API rate limits, fresher data, or analytics dashboards as part of paid tiers.
3. **Validate product-market fit** â€“ Free users help test and provide feedback; conversions indicate monetization potential.
4. **Optimize for different personas** â€“ Governments, students, and developers may stay on the free tier, while enterprises adopt premium plans.

In ODPS (Open Data Product Specification), this is supported under the `pricingPlans` section using a structure like:

```yaml
pricingPlans:
    declarative:
      en:
        - name: Basic Reader
          priceCurrency: USD
          price: 0
          billingDuration: month
          unit: recurring
          maxTransactionQuantity: 100
          offering:
            - Standard access to event metadata
            - Up to 100 SQL queries per month
            - Shared SLA (best-effort availability)
            - No prioritization in case of peaks
        - name: High Volume Access
            priceCurrency: USD
            price: 2000
            billingDuration: month
            unit: recurring
            maxTransactionQuantity: 500000
            offering:
              - Dedicated API channel for bulk usage
              - 'Up to 500,000 SQL queries per month'
              - Guaranteed SLA for availability and response time
```

This model is scalable and allows pricing to evolve over time based on usage patterns and demand.
