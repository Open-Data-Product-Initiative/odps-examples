# How do I define data quality rules?

The Open Data Product Specification (ODPS) makes data quality (DQ) an explicit, structured component of any data product. You can define clear, measurable rules for different quality dimensions and attach them to pricing plans.

Letâ€™s break it down with a real example.

## Where is data quality defined?

In the ODPS YAML, the `dataQuality` section holds the rules. Here's the starting structure:

```yaml
dataQuality:
  declarative:
    default:
        displaytitle:
        en: Complete Data Quality Set
        description:
        en: Includes all defined data quality dimensions.
        dimensions:
```

Each quality **dimension** is then defined with a name, description, and an objective value. For example:

```yaml
- dimension: accuracy
  displaytitle:
    en: Data Accuracy
  description:
    en: How well the data reflects the real-world entities or events it represents.
  objective: 95
  unit: percent
```

This means the data product should maintain **95% accuracy**.

**The Role of `default`**

The `default` quality profile is **mandatory** whenever the `dataQuality` object is used. It acts as the **baseline** definition, ensuring there is always a clear and predictable quality configuration, even when no referencing is used.

You should use the `default` profile when:

- You want to describe core quality expectations for the product.
- You donâ€™t yet need pricing or SLA-specific variations.
- You want to ensure future compatibility with advanced features such as AI agents, data marketplaces, or automated governance.

This makes the `default` profile both a **minimum requirement** and a **best practice** for clarity and interoperability.

## What kind of dimensions can I use?

Here are some dimensions defined in the example:

- **Accuracy**: Real-world representation
- **Completeness**: All required data attributes present
- **Conformity**: Adherence to syntax or schema
- **Consistency**: Uniform values across datasets
- **Coverage**: Extent of records present
- **Timeliness**: How current the data is
- **Validity**: Logical correctness
- **Uniqueness**: No duplicates

Each has a percentage objective. These act like contracts for data quality expectations.

## How do I use DQ in pricing plans?

Once you've defined DQ rules, you can reuse them via a `$ref`:

```yaml
dataQuality:
  $ref: '#/dataQuality/default'
```

This makes the `default` DQ package available to any pricing plan or product configuration. It avoids duplication and allows you to manage DQ rules in one place.

## Why does this matter?

ODPS helps shift quality from abstract claims to measurable commitments. This supports trust, comparisons, and automation.
